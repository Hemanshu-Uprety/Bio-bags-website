Bio Bags Website
=================

Overview
--------
Bio Bags Website is a lightweight, static front-end project built with Vite. It provides a simple marketing/presentation site for the "Bio Bags" concept — showcasing product information, brand assets, and minimal interactive behavior via a compact JS/CSS codebase.

Key Features
------------
- Clean, responsive single-page layout for showcasing product visuals and copy.
- Lightweight asset structure with an organized `assets/images` folder for logos and imagery.
- Minimal JS in `src/main.js` to enable small interactions or analytics hooks.

Tech Stack
----------
- Vite: fast development server and build tooling.
- Vanilla JavaScript: located in `bio-bags-website/src/main.js`.
- CSS: simple styles in `bio-bags-website/src/main.css`.
- Static assets: `bio-bags-website/assets/images/logo.jfif`.

Repository Structure
-------------------
- `index.html` — Entry HTML for the site (Vite-compatible).
- `vite.config.js` — Vite configuration for dev/build.
- `package.json` — npm scripts and dependencies.
- `bio-bags-website/` — Core site folder:
  - `assets/images/` — Logos and images.
  - `src/main.css` — Main stylesheet.
  - `src/main.js` — Entry JavaScript for interactivity.

Getting Started (Development)
----------------------------
1. Install dependencies:

	npm install

2. Run the dev server:

	npm run dev

3. Open the local dev URL shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Building for Production
-----------------------
1. Create an optimized build:

	npm run build

2. Preview the production build locally:

	npm run preview

Notes for Contributors
----------------------
- Keep assets small and optimized for web (use compressed JPEG/WEBP/PNG where appropriate).
- Prefer semantic HTML in `index.html` and keep styles in `src/main.css`.
- If adding JS behavior, keep it modular and minimal in `src/main.js` to retain fast load times.

Customization
-------------
- Replace `assets/images/logo.jfif` with your brand artwork and update references in `index.html`.
- Edit `src/main.css` to adjust theme colors, spacing, and typography.
